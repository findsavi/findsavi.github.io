			<h1>SAVI Guess My Number Game Instructions:</h1>
				First you have to guess n, where n is randomly generated number falls in between 1 and 99. If your guess is wrong addition then division operation will be done between n and guess so that the resultant (quotient) always falls in between 1 and 99. And least possible natural number is chosen as divisor to perform division only if the (n+guess) addition is greater than 100 and the divisor is leat possible natural number i.e., factor . Else addition will be performed. Now you have to find resultant. If you fail, again addition or addition plus division operation with least factor will be performed. Like this it continues till you find out resultant correctly.
